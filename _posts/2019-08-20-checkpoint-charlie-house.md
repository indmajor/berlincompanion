Part of this house belongs to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. It was a contribution of Peter Eisenmann and Jaquelin Robertson to the International Building Exhibition 1987 in the West Berlin. Peter Eisenmann would later built the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. The building consists of two superimposed grids. One is aligned with the border of the former Friedrichstadt block, the other with the geographical directions. The history is played against the present, where the Berlin wall separates the East and the West.
