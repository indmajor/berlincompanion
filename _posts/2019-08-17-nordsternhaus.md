Nordsternhaus in Berlin-Schöneberg. It’s an office building built by Paul Mobes in 1914 for the insurance company Nordstern, with 900 workplaces. It was heavily damaged during the war. In 1945, because of the uncertain situation in Berlin, the company moved its staff to Cologne. Since 1950s it has been occupied by the government authorities of Berlin. It now houses Berlin’s Senate Department for Justice.
