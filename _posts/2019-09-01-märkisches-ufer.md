In 1960s the GDR designated this river bank as an 'island of tradition'. Several historical buildings that stayed in the way of new development projects were moved here: number 10, the Ermeler house, built in 1770 and number 12 built in 1740. The rest of the houses were built here: number 16 in the 1780s, number 18 in 1741, number 20 in 1874.
