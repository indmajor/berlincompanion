Friedrichswerde Church (1824-1830) by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, probably the architect who shaped Berlin the most. His usual style is Neoclassical, but Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm IV wished for ‘Old German’ Gothic style. The result is a fascinating mixture of both. Unfortunately the church is now cornered by modern buildings of the rebuilt Mitte, with little space to quietly admire the architecture. Moreover, it is closed since 2012 due to structural damage.
