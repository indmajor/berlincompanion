Lise Meitner was one of the physicists who discovered the nuclear fission. She was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in Germany. After losing her position because of the anti-Jewish laws, she fled to Sweden in 1938. This monument by Anna Franziska Schwarzbach was erected here in 2014.
