Another place in Berlin full of history: built in 1905 for an artisan’s association, this house became a seedbed of revolutionary labour movement. Rosa Luxembourg, Karl Liebknecht, Wilhelm Pieck and Clara Zetkin among others spoke at the meetings here; including the first public meeting of the Spartacus League. During the time of National Socialism the association was banned, and the building complex was used as a labor camp. In the GDR, workshops of the Maxim Gorki Theater were located here. Finally in 1996 it was reopened as an independent theater Sophiensaele with Sasha Waltz as director.
