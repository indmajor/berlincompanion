Hussitenstrasse 4 is the remnant of the huge residential complex built in 1904 by a charitable building society. The architectural styles of the courtyards were supposed to illustrate the development of Berlin: Romanesque, Gothic, Nuremeberg style, Renaissance, Baroque, Wilhelmine. But more important than architecture was provision of comfortable and affordable accommodation to the rapidly growing population of the city. All apartments had its own kitchen and bathroom, which was unusual for that time. Most of the complex was destroyed during the war, but one can still go through the Romanesque, Gothic and Nuremberg courtyards.
