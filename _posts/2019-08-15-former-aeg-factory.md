The former manufacturing complex of the electrical company AEG is a perfect, quiet place in Berlin Mitte to reflect on the modern economic history. It was designed by Peter Behrens, who was the first to create monumental, spacious “temples” of industrial production, of which this place is an example. Now its buildings belong to Technology and Innovation Park Berlin. The vast courtyard is accessible from Voltastraße and Gustav-Meyer-Allee. One can almost hear the sounds of the factory when the wind whistles in the old vents.
