Mossehaus in Berlin’s Newspaper district. The original sandstone building was erected in 1900-1903, commissioned by one of the most successful German publishers Rudolf Mosse. It was damaged during the revolutionary unrest in 1919. The reshaping was done by the famous Erich Mendelsohn, who gave it a dynamic, futuristic form. Parts of Erich Mendelsohn’s structure were destroyed during the war. The building was renovated in 1992-93.
