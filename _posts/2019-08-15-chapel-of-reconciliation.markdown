The Chapel of Reconciliation, built in 1999, stands where the Church of Reconciliation, a late 19th century construction, stood before being demolished by the GDR in 1985. The Berlin Wall ran directly in front of the church, separating it and its parish in the French sector. It is also a rare example in Germany of a public building made of clay (the inner wall).
