Former administration building of ADGB (confederation of German trade unions) designed by Max Taut andÂ Franz Hoffmann. It is one of the first buildings where concrete frame was used as the main design element. Its plan became a model for the Neues Bauen (New Building) movement and helped Max Taut gain prominence as its leading architect.
