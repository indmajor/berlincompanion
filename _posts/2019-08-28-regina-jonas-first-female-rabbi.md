At Krausnickstra√üe 6 a plaque commemorates the first female rabbi in the world, Regina Jonas. She gave sermons in many synagogues of Berlin, up until her deportation in 1942 to Theresienstadt. There she continued her work as a rabbi and also provided psychological help, especially to the newly arrived, who were under a state of shock and despair. After two years at Theresienstadt she was deported to Auschwitz where she was murdered.

On the plaque there is her quote: "God has put ability and vocation in us without asking about the gender. Therefore everyone has the duty, man or woman, to work and create according to the gift that God has given them."
