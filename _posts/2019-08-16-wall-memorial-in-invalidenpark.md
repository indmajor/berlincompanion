Wall memorial in Invalidenpark: the park had not been used since the war, after it’s church had been destroyed and the Wall had been built nearby, until the reconstruction we can see today was completed in 1997. The main feature is Sinking Wall fountain, which the architect Christophe Girot described as “track in the future”.
