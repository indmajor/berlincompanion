Chamber Music Hall of the Berliner Philharmonie, designed by Edgar Wisniewski according to the sketch left by his teacher Hans Scharoun, the famous architect of the main building. Because of its smaller proportions itâ€™s much easier to comprehend than the iconic main building, and the architectural style is very similar.
