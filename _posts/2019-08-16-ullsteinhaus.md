Ullsteinhaus is a remarkable example of Brick Expressionist architecture. It was built by Eugen Schmohl (also architect of the Borsigturm) for an Ullstein Verlag, a publishing company. In 1934 the business of the Ullstein family was aryanized. The company was renamed “Deutscher Verlag” and the building “Deutsches Haus”. After the war the publishing house was restored to the family. Now the building is being used by a variety of companies, but the symbol of the Ullstein Verlag, an owl, is still there.
