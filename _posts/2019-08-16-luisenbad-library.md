Bibliothek am Luisenbad. The history of the place dates back to 1760, when baths were opened here in then rural Gesundbrunnen district. Swimming pool, restaurant, cafe, beer garden and cinema were later added. Baths were destroyed during the bombing in 1945, other buildings demolished in the 1970s. The remains have been integrated into a modern library building, designed by Rebecca Chestnutt and Robert Niess. The library is filled with natural light and surrounded by a reading-garden.
