Ida-Simon-Palais on the Spree, opposite the Museum Island, was built in 1911 as a clinic for girls and women who didn’t have social insurance and couldn’t afford to go to a private doctor. It was funded by Ida Simon, who left 300,000 marks in her will to be used to “support women and girls irrespective of their beliefs, who suffer from acute or chronic health problems”. Now the building consists of luxurious apartments.
