Only two watchtowers from the Berlin Wall remain – this one was preserved thanks to the efforts of Jürgen Litfin, the brother of Günter Litfin, who was the first one to be shot while trying to flee to West Berlin, in 1961. Instead of the wall there is now a nice promenade along the Spree and a district called Europacity is being built on the other side.
