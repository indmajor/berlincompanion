The first orphanage was opened in 1882, intended to house Jewish children who escaped the pogroms of 1881-82 in Russia. Later it housed orphanages from Berlin. After the fire damaged the original building, the current one was erected in 1912-13 by Alexander Beer. Following the pogroms in 1938 the director Kurt Crohn succeed in bringing many children to the Netherlands and the UK. In 1942 the orphanage was forcibly closed, remaining children and teachers were deported to the concentration camps. It reopened after extensive restorations in the 2000s as a district library and a school.
