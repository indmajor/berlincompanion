A residential park built in 1897 and named in honour of the princess Anna Amalie of Prussia, a composer and sister of the king Frederick the Great (you can find her on Spotify!) One of the best known East German writers, Christa Wolf, lived here. A sculpture in your memory, “Mask of Medea”, by Christine Dewerny is installed in front of her house. At the entrance there is a composition “Seated Couple” by Carin Kreuzberg.
