The Mirrored Wall is a memorial to the deported Jews from Berlin-Steglitz and to the former Synagogue. Inscribed are the records from the deportation lists with names and addresses of local Jewish residents. The memorial was erected after a prolonged political fight in the local parliament - CDU, FDP and The Republicans formed a coalition against it. Their resistance was only overcome when the construction senator Wolfgang Nagel from SPD ordered it to be built, in 1995.
