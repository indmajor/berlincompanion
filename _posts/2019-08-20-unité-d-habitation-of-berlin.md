Le Corbusier's contribution to the International Building Exhibition 1957. It is a version of a building that he had previously built in Marseille and Nantes. Corbusier's original idea included a self-contained city with a kindergarten, stores and social services. However the Berlin authorities cancelled everything except the building itself.
